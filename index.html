    <div class="letter">
      <p class=address>Portsmouth Council,</p>
      <p>This letter is written to you in reference to application XXXXXXXXX for a convex mirror to be installed on the corner of Richmond Place, PO1 3DE on behalf of the undersigned.</p>
      <p>I would first like to take the chance to applaud your ongoing commitment to the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and othe road users both generally and with specific regard to the crossroads at the intersection of Burnaby Road and Park Road in the Gunwharf area. The installation of cycle lights has reduced the chance of collision with cyclists, and the 'cross' across the roadway has provided a safer, more efficient means for pedestrians to cross from one side of the road to the other. however we believe there is further to be done to improve safety in this area.</p>
      <p>Richmond Place is an access road running adjacent to Richmond Building, Portsmouth, PO1 3DE. Richmond Place connects directly to the intersection of Portland Street and Burnaby Road, but does so around a completely blind corner, this is not an issue for most road-users as the vast majority of traffic flow is from Portland Street to Burnaby Road, however Richmond place is frequently used as an access road for Motorcycles to park by Richmond Building for access into the University of Portsmouth. The issue Motorcyclist's face is in emerging from this access road into the main traffic flow.</p>
      <p>Joining from the access road and turning right onto Burnaby Road is extremely dangerous as during the process of emerging, one must cross the path of oncoming traffic to get to the correct side of the already narrow road through blind traffic. It is particularly dangerous at night when visibility is further reduced, as oncoming traffic can see Portland Street is clear and assume there are no further hazards.</p>
      <p>The outcome of this is that there is a high-risk to Car Drivers, Motorcyclists, and Pedestrians as around this corner no read user can see one another. <strong>Therefore it is we, the undersigned's proposal that a curved mirror be installed on the corner of these 3 roads so all parties can see each other more easily, reducing the likelihood of an accident, and reducing the risk to pedestrians in the area.</strong></p>
      <p>The cost of surverying, installing, and purchasing a curved mirror is understandably high, however we believe the cost of this will be offset by the cost of even a single accident on this piece of road.</p>
      <p>We look forward to working with you to make the roads of Portsmouth a safer place for all,</p>
      <p>Yours gratefully,</p>
